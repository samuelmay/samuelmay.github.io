      <h1>I Got a Framework Laptop</h1>
      <p>I&rsquo;ve been following the Framework laptop since it was announced. A few weeks ago I finally got the email that they were taking pre-orders in Australia. I jumped right on it. Yesterday, it arrived!</p>
<p><img src="/images/unboxing1_small.jpg" alt="Opening the box"></p>
<p>I (of course) got the DIY edition with an SSD and memory stick included separately. It arrived with a Torx screwdriver included and the laptop components in their OEM packaging.</p>
<p><img src="/images/unboxing2_small.jpg" alt="Opening the box"></p>
<p>You loosen 5 screws on the bottom (they&rsquo;re captive, so there&rsquo;s no opportunity to lose them), turn it over, and gently pry off the keyboard panel.</p>
<p><img src="/images/unboxing3_small.jpg" alt="Opening the box"></p>
<p>The storage and memory sticks clicked in fairly easily, just like for a PC build, but slightly smaller. I&rsquo;m already thinking about a memory upgrade haha. I only bought it with 8Gb to save a bit of money.</p>
<p><img src="/images/unboxing4_small.jpg" alt="Opening the box"></p>
<p>Now installing the OS was actually a bit harder. I had a hell of a time creating a Fedora live usb drive. The Fedora Media Writer is a great little program but it doesn&rsquo;t work if Windows Security file monitoring is turned on. Additionally, it <em>also turns itself back on</em> after a short period of being turned off. I suppose I can grudgingly agree with that as an idiot-proof security default. But it took a couple of tries to format the darn thumb drive.</p>
<p>Once the live usb drive booted, installing to disk was easy. I was quite impressed with the stuff that works out of the box (Zoom videoconferencing with webcam and a Bluetooth headset!) But there was the usual faffing installing all the necessary non-free software on Fedora, like codecs, video drivers and DRM media playback.</p>
<p>Another thing that was surprisingly difficult, was remapping the Ctrl and Caps Lock keys. I have to say that I was fondly thinking about Windows Power Toys with a bit of regret, while browsing random Github repos looking for a suitable keyboard remapper. I ended up going with <a href="https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd">keyd</a> which I had to install with <code>make &amp;&amp; sudo make install</code> just like old times.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re all go now. This post was written in VSCode with the Neovim plugin, on a Framework!</p>
